# ex split hhkb

HHKB is a layout that's really close to my heart. I've grown past my rubberdome days and started to develop some slight RSI which made me think I should build a split version of the hhkb. It's probably not good for RSI but it could at least be a good looking keyboard.

### Spacebar

The layout is currently is a regular hhkb layout with a split spacebar. Left side uses a 2.25U spacebar and the right side uses a 2.75U spacebar which is still 1U shorter than the hhkb with its 6U spacebar. Design-wise this is breaking the hhkb look-and-feel and due to this I had to adjust the left alt/ctrl (1U mod) more to the right. This is subject to change.
